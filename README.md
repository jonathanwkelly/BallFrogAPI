# Overview
 
Our REST API provides read-only access to the same data that powers our mobile app. The purpose of exposing this data is to allow other entities to develop their own presentation of the real-time, official, sports data that we collect.

---

#### API Access
An API key can be generated for any active BallFrog App account. This key will need to be sent with each request.

To get setup with a key, send your request to [questions@ballfrog.com](mailto:questions@ballfrog.com), including the following details:

 * Your full name
 * Email address associated with BallFrog account (if different) 
 * Phone number
 * Brief description of intended use of API

If you donâ€™t have an active account, you can install our app from the iTunes or Android app stores, or visit our mobile app at [http://app.ballfrog.com](http://app.ballfrog.com) to sign up. You'll need an activated account before we can provide you with an API key.

---

#### Available Data
Most of the Team, Organization, and Game data displayed within our app are available through the API. See the corresponding "Making Requests" section to see exact data points.

---

#### Request Types
The API is currently read-only, so, following the RESTful approach, GET requests are expected. 

---

#### Response Format
All responses are JSON formatted.


# Making Requests
#### API Endpoint
```
https://api.ballfrog.com
```

---

####Authentication
Since the REST API is stateless, all requests must include your API key.

```
GET https://api.ballfrog.com/team?id=320&key=123abc
```

---

#### Team Data

```
@PARAM id {number} One or multiple, comma-delimited ID's

@PARAM org_id {number} One or multiple, comma-delimited ID's

@PARAM state {string} Two-digit state short name, e.g. TN

@PARAM limit {number} 1-50; defaults to 10

**Each team manages their own schedule. What this means is that there could exist a game record for Team A vs. Team B, but also another for Team B vs. Team A. If Team ID(s) or School ID(s) are passed in, the API will just search for game records created under the passed in Teams/Schools, and not return games where those Teams/Schools are selected as the opponent.*

***There is logic within the BallFrog system to determine what game is considered "current" for a team. It may be a game happening later that day, or a game from the prior day if no game is on the schedule for the current day.*
